    <h3>Cocacola</h3>
    <p>The list has been pretty static from since 2011. The only change was Fanta moving to spot 9 and Diet Dr.
         Pepper falling to 10 in 2012 and falling out of the top 10 for 2013.
        I had a Red Bull with breakfast this morning and realized I had built up way too much a tolerance to caffeine.
         When I started on Red Bull in 7th grade, my first one was a kick in the pants. Today, I was sitting in class 
        less than an hour after breakfast and my eyelids were falling. So now I am drinking a bottle of Morning Spark
         and brewing a pot of Meth Coffee... both products that I was introduced to right here on EnergyFiend.</p>

    <h3>Coke</h3>
    <p>Both Coca-cola and Pepsi lost market share. Coca-cola can blame it on the CEO – after all they only paid him
         $32 million dollars for his year’s work. This downward trend has continued.OK so, I get up and I've got so 
        little awakeness that I sometimes have to lean on the wall to keep from falling over. In the bathroom I often
         take a caffeine pill, usually 200mg. At the table, I usually drink a cup of tea and a Hype, which helps a lot.
         Then while on the bus or while waiting for the bus I like to pop a few caffeine mints. I also like to bring
         something to drink at lunch. A bottle of Bawls seems best, since you get a pretty good amount for a school 
        lunch and the caffeine content is pretty good.</p>

    <h3>Others Drinks</h3>
    <p>Energy Drinks had a massive 49% growth – but total market share is just 0.8% (which makes you wonder about all
         the over-enthusiastic media reporting). (07)Take a break. Seriously. It's worth it to let your system clear
         out a bit every now and then. I usually go for a month or two and then take a week (or as long as I can, really) off.</p>
